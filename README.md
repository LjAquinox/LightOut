# LightOut
Calculate the optimal solution to solve a lights out game, shit code in french good luck with that

I am unsure if it was a working version, but it should be fine.
The code was made a while ago and wasn't supposed to be posted on github so it is basicaly terrible to read + it's in french
We finished the code properly with user interface and all but can't find it if you need it send message I'll look more into it.
